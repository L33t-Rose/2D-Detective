# 2D-Detective

This is a game made in Unity that I worked on for my "Game Development For Everyone" course. I worked with a different person named Carl Cai.

I worked on the code, the UI & the Engine while he worked on the script and the assets.

This game is a WebGL game hosted on itch.io
You can check it out [here](https://l33tmaster.itch.io/2d-detective).

The game's engine mostly uses Unity's UI API. Everything from the textboxes to the interacting with the background is done through the UI API.
I did this because a visual novel game doesn't have much mechanics and therefore doesn't need to use the `Update()` method.
